# Basic-Python-Calculator

A basic command line calculator written in Python as a learning project.

This calculator allows the user to:
- Enter a numerator and perform chained operations (`+ - * /`)
- Optionally enter a denominator with its own chained operations
- Handle basic invalid input and division-by-zero cases
- Display the final result in the terminal

## Features

- Command-line interface
- Supports multiple operations in sequence
- Input validation for numeric values
- Handling of undefined division
- Written using Python 3 (`match` statement)

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a numerator.
2. The user may apply multiple operations to the numerator.
3. The user is then prompted to enter an optional denominator.
4. The denominator can also be modified with multiple operations.
5. The final result is printed
